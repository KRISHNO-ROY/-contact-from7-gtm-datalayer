GTM DataLayer for Contact Form 7 Tracking with All Inputs Values (hashed email)
How to use
In Google Tag Manager, create a new tag as a custom HTML tag.
Inside the tag, paste the entire code from the cf7-datalayer.js or cf7-hashed-email-datalayer.js (if hashed email is required) file provided in this repository. Don't forget to wrap the code with <script> tag.
Set the trigger to fire on All Pages page views.
Once you've configured this setup, you'll begin receiving Google Tag Manager dataLayer events as cf7_submit. You will get form ID as formId and all other form inputs.
